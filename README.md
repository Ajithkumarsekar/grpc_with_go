### What is gRPC?
Developed by google (2015). It uses `HTTP/2` for transport, `Protocol Buffers` as the default `interface description language`
### what is interface description language?
IDL is a generic term for a language that lets a program or object written in one language communicate with another program written in an unknown language. IDLs describe an interface in a language-independent way, enabling communication between software components that do not share one language, for example, between those written in C++ and those written in Java.
Popular IDL used with gRPC `Apache Thrift` (by Facebook), `Apache Avro`, `Flatbuffers` (by Google)
### Unary RPC flow?

### can gRPC method be called without generated stub (client code)?
yes, using gRPC reflections. gRPC Server Reflection provides information about publicly-accessible gRPC services on a server, and assists clients at runtime to construct RPC requests and responses without precompiled service information.
### What is evans?
[evans](https://github.com/ktr0731/evans) is a generic gRPC command line client which uses either gRPC server reflection or proto files to construct, decode RPC request, response
